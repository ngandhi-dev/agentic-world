The feature arrives as a research preview available exclusively to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11014257-about-claude-s-max-plan-usage&quot;&gt;Claude Max subscribers&lt;/a&gt; — Anthropic&amp;#x27;s power-user tier priced between $100 and $200 per month — through the macOS desktop application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past year, the industry narrative has focused on large language models that can write poetry or debug code. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview&quot;&gt;Cowork&lt;/a&gt;, Anthropic is betting that the real enterprise value lies in an AI that can open a folder, read a messy pile of receipts, and generate a structured expense report without human hand-holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How developers using a coding tool for vacation research inspired Anthropic&amp;#x27;s latest product&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genesis of &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview&quot;&gt;Cowork&lt;/a&gt; lies in Anthropic&amp;#x27;s recent success with the developer community. In late 2024, the company released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet&quot;&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt;, a terminal-based tool that allowed software engineers to automate rote programming tasks. The tool was a hit, but Anthropic noticed a peculiar trend: users were forcing the coding tool to perform non-coding labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/bcherny/status/2010809450844831752&quot;&gt;Boris Cherny&lt;/a&gt;, an engineer at Anthropic, the company observed users deploying the developer tool for an unexpectedly diverse array of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Since we launched Claude Code, we saw people using it for all sorts of non-coding work: doing vacation research, building slide decks, cleaning up your email, cancelling subscriptions, recovering wedding photos from a hard drive, monitoring plant growth, controlling your oven,&amp;quot; Cherny wrote on X. &amp;quot;These use cases are diverse and surprising — the reason is that the underlying Claude Agent is the best agent, and Opus 4.5 is the best model.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing this shadow usage, Anthropic effectively stripped the command-line complexity from their developer tool to create a consumer-friendly interface. In its blog post announcing the feature, &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview&quot;&gt;Anthropic explained&lt;/a&gt; that developers &amp;quot;quickly began using it for almost everything else,&amp;quot; which &amp;quot;prompted us to build Cowork: a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude in the very same way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inside the folder-based architecture that lets Claude read, edit, and create files on your computer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike a standard chat interface where a user pastes text for analysis, &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview&quot;&gt;Cowork&lt;/a&gt; requires a different level of trust and access. Users designate a specific folder on their local machine that Claude can access. Within that sandbox, the AI agent can read existing files, modify them, or create entirely new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic offers several illustrative examples: reorganizing a cluttered downloads folder by sorting and intelligently renaming each file, generating a spreadsheet of expenses from a collection of receipt screenshots, or drafting a report from scattered notes across multiple documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In Cowork, you give Claude access to a folder on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder,&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/claudeai/status/2010805685530038351&quot;&gt;the company explained&lt;/a&gt; on X. &amp;quot;Try it to create a spreadsheet from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft from scattered notes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The architecture relies on what is known as an &amp;quot;agentic loop.&amp;quot; When a user assigns a task, the AI does not merely generate a text response. Instead, it formulates a plan, executes steps in parallel, checks its own work, and asks for clarification if it hits a roadblock. Users can queue multiple tasks and let Claude process them simultaneously — a workflow Anthropic describes as feeling &amp;quot;much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is built on Anthropic&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk&quot;&gt;Claude Agent SDK&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it shares the same underlying architecture as Claude Code. Anthropic notes that Cowork &amp;quot;can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The recursive loop where AI builds AI: Claude Code reportedly wrote much of Claude Cowork&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most remarkable detail surrounding Cowork&amp;#x27;s launch is the speed at which the tool was reportedly built — highlighting a recursive feedback loop where AI tools are being used to build better AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a livestream hosted by Dan Shipper, Felix Rieseberg, an Anthropic employee, confirmed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/blakeir/status/2010837251505205656&quot;&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;he team &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/blakeir/status/2010837251505205656&quot;&gt;built Cowork in approximately a week and a half&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Volkov, who covers AI developments, expressed surprise at the timeline: &amp;quot;Holy shit Anthropic built &amp;#x27;Cowork&amp;#x27; in the last... week and a half?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prompted immediate speculation about how much of Cowork was itself built by Claude Code. &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/_simonsmith&quot;&gt;Simon Smith&lt;/a&gt;, EVP of Generative AI at Klick Health, put it bluntly on X: &amp;quot;Claude Code wrote all of Claude Cowork. Can we all agree that we&amp;#x27;re in at least somewhat of a recursive improvement loop here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implication is profound: Anthropic&amp;#x27;s AI coding agent may have substantially contributed to building its own non-technical sibling product. If true, this is one of the most visible examples yet of AI systems being used to accelerate their own development and expansion — a strategy that could widen the gap between AI labs that successfully deploy their own agents internally and those that do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Connectors, browser automation, and skills extend Cowork&amp;#x27;s reach beyond the local file system&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cowork doesn&amp;#x27;t operate in isolation. The feature integrates with Anthropic&amp;#x27;s existing ecosystem of connectors — tools that link &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=%2Fnew%3F&quot;&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt; to external information sources and services such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://asana.com/&quot;&gt;Asana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.com/&quot;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.com/us/home&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt;, and other supported partners. Users who have configured these connections in the standard Claude interface can leverage them within Cowork sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Cowork can pair with &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome&quot;&gt;Claude in Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s browser extension, to execute tasks requiring web access. This combination allows the agent to navigate websites, click buttons, fill forms, and extract information from the internet — all while operating from the desktop application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cowork includes a number of novel UX and safety features that we think make the product really special,&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/bcherny/status/2010809450844831752&quot;&gt;Cherny explained&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting &amp;quot;a built-in VM [virtual machine] for isolation, out of the box support for browser automation, support for all your claude.ai data connectors, asking you for clarification when it&amp;#x27;s unsure.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/&quot;&gt;Anthropic&lt;/a&gt; has also introduced an initial set of &amp;quot;skills&amp;quot; specifically designed for Cowork that enhance Claude&amp;#x27;s ability to create documents, presentations, and other files. These build on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills&quot;&gt;Skills for Claude&lt;/a&gt; framework the company announced in October, which provides specialized instruction sets Claude can load for particular types of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Anthropic is warning users that its own AI agent could delete their files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition from a chatbot that suggests edits to an agent that makes edits introduces significant risk. An AI that can organize files can, theoretically, delete them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a notable display of transparency, Anthropic devoted considerable space in its announcement to &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview&quot;&gt;warning users about Cowork&amp;#x27;s potential dangers&lt;/a&gt; — an unusual approach for a product launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company explicitly acknowledges that Claude &amp;quot;can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it&amp;#x27;s instructed to.&amp;quot; Because Claude might occasionally misinterpret instructions, Anthropic urges users to provide &amp;quot;very clear guidance&amp;quot; about sensitive operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More concerning is the risk of prompt injection attacks — a technique where malicious actors embed hidden instructions in content Claude might encounter online, potentially causing the agent to bypass safeguards or take harmful actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;ve built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections,&amp;quot; Anthropic wrote, &amp;quot;but agent safety — that is, the task of securing Claude&amp;#x27;s real-world actions — is still an active area of development in the industry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company characterized these risks as inherent to the current state of AI agent technology rather than unique to Cowork. &amp;quot;These risks aren&amp;#x27;t new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you&amp;#x27;re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation,&amp;quot; the announcement notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s desktop agent strategy sets up a direct challenge to Microsoft Copilot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview&quot;&gt;Cowork&lt;/a&gt; places Anthropic in direct competition with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, which has spent years attempting to integrate its &lt;a href=&quot;https://copilot.microsoft.com/&quot;&gt;Copilot AI&lt;/a&gt; into the fabric of the Windows operating system with mixed adoption results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s approach differs in its isolation. By confining the agent to specific folders and requiring explicit connectors, they are attempting to strike a balance between the utility of an OS-level agent and the security of a sandboxed application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes Anthropic&amp;#x27;s approach is its bottom-up evolution. Rather than designing an AI assistant and retrofitting agent capabilities, Anthropic built a powerful coding agent first — &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview&quot;&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt; — and is now abstracting its capabilities for broader audiences. This technical lineage may give Cowork more robust agentic behavior from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude Code has generated significant enthusiasm among developers since its initial launch as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet&quot;&gt;a command-line tool in late 2024&lt;/a&gt;. The company expanded access with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/claude-code-gets-a-web-version-but-its-the-new-sandboxing-that-really-matters/&quot;&gt;web interface&lt;/a&gt; in October 2025, followed by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropics-claude-code-can-now-read-your-slack-messages-and-write-code-for&quot;&gt;Slack integration&lt;/a&gt; in December. Cowork is the next logical step: bringing the same agentic architecture to users who may never touch a terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who can access Cowork now, and what&amp;#x27;s coming next for Windows and other platforms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Cowork remains exclusive to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11014257-about-claude-s-max-plan-usage&quot;&gt;Claude Max subscribers&lt;/a&gt; using the macOS desktop application. Users on other subscription tiers — Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise — can join a waitlist for future access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has signaled clear intentions to expand the feature&amp;#x27;s reach. The blog post explicitly mentions plans to add cross-device sync and bring Cowork to Windows as the company learns from the research preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cherny set expectations appropriately, describing the product as &amp;quot;early and raw, similar to what Claude Code felt like when it first launched.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To access &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview&quot;&gt;Cowork&lt;/a&gt;, Max subscribers can download or update the Claude macOS app and click on &amp;quot;Cowork&amp;quot; in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The real question facing enterprise AI adoption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For technical decision-makers, the implications of Cowork extend beyond any single product launch. The bottleneck for AI adoption is shifting — no longer is model intelligence the limiting factor, but rather workflow integration and user trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s goal, as the company puts it, is to make working with Claude feel less like operating a tool and more like delegating to a colleague. Whether mainstream users are ready to hand over folder access to an AI that might misinterpret their instructions remains an open question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the speed of Cowork&amp;#x27;s development — a major feature built in ten days, possibly by the company&amp;#x27;s own AI — previews a future where the capabilities of these systems compound faster than organizations can evaluate them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chatbot has learned to use a file manager. What it learns to use next is anyone&amp;#x27;s guess.&lt;/p&gt; </div> <div class="snippet-section"> <h3>Original Context</h3> <p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/&quot;&gt;Anthropic&lt;/a&gt; released &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview&quot;&gt;Cowork&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, a new AI agent capability that extends the power of its wildly successful &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.com/product/claude-code&quot;&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt; tool to non-technical users — and according to company insiders, the team built the entire feature in approximately a week and a half, largely using Claude Code itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch marks a major inflection point in the race to deliver practical AI agents to mainstream users, positioning Anthropic to compete not just with &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/&quot;&gt;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gemini.google.com/app&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; in conversational AI, but with &lt;a href=&quot;https://copilot.microsoft.com/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&amp;#x27;s Copilot&lt;/a&gt; in the burgeoning market for AI-powered productivity tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cowork lets you complete non-technical tasks much like how developers use Claude Code,&amp;quot; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/claudeai/status/2010805682434666759?s=20&quot;&gt;company announced&lt;/a&gt; via its official Claude account on X.

Users who have configured these connections in the standard Claude interface can leverage them within Cowork sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Cowork can pair with &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome&quot;&gt;Claude in Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s browser extension, to execute tasks requiring web access. This combination allows the agent to navigate websites, click buttons, fill forms, and extract information from the internet — all while operating from the desktop application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cowork includes a number of novel UX and safety features that we think make the product really special,&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/bcherny/status/2010809450844831752&quot;&gt;Cherny explained&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting &amp;quot;a built-in VM [virtual machine] for isolation, out of the box support for browser automation, support for all your claude.ai data connectors, asking you for clarification when it&amp;#x27;s unsure.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/&quot;&gt;Anthropic&lt;/a&gt; has also introduced an initial set of &amp;quot;skills&amp;quot; specifically designed for Cowork that enhance Claude&amp;#x27;s ability to create documents, presentations, and other files. These build on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills&quot;&gt;Skills for Claude&lt;/a&gt; framework the company announced in October, which provides specialized instruction sets Claude can load for particular types of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Anthropic is warning users that its own AI agent could delete their files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transition from a chatbot that suggests edits to an agent that makes edits introduces significant risk. An AI that can organize files can, theoretically, delete them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a notable display of transparency, Anthropic devoted considerable space in its announcement to &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview&quot;&gt;warning users about Cowork&amp;#x27;s potential dangers&lt;/a&gt; — an unusual approach for a product launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company explicitly acknowledges that Claude &amp;quot;can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it&amp;#x27;s instructed to.&amp;quot; Because Claude might occasionally misinterpret instructions, Anthropic urges users to provide &amp;quot;very clear guidance&amp;quot; about sensitive operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More concerning is the risk of prompt injection attacks — a technique where malicious actors embed hidden instructions in content Claude might encounter online, potentially causing the agent to bypass safeguards or take harmful actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#x27;ve built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections,&amp;quot; Anthropic wrote, &amp;quot;but agent safety — that is, the task of securing Claude&amp;#x27;s real-world actions — is still an active area of development in the industry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company characterized these risks as inherent to the current state of AI agent technology rather than unique to Cowork. &amp;quot;These risks aren&amp;#x27;t new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you&amp;#x27;re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation,&amp;quot; the announcement notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s desktop agent strategy sets up a direct challenge to Microsoft Copilot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview&quot;&gt;Cowork&lt;/a&gt; places Anthropic in direct competition with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, which has spent years attempting to integrate its &lt;a href=&quot;https://copilot.microsoft.com/&quot;&gt;Copilot AI&lt;/a&gt; into the fabric of the Windows operating system with mixed adoption results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Anthropic&amp;#x27;s approach differs in its isolation. By confining the agent to specific folders and requiring explicit connectors, they are attempting to strike a balance between the utility of an OS-level agent and the security of a sandboxed application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes Anthropic&amp;#x27;s approach is its bottom-up evolution. Rather than designing an AI assistant and retrofitting agent capabilities, Anthropic built a powerful coding agent first — &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview&quot;&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt; — and is now abstracting its capabilities for broader audiences. This technical lineage may give Cowork more robust agentic behavior from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude Code has generated significant enthusiasm among developers since its initial launch as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet&quot;&gt;a command-line tool in late 2024&lt;/a&gt;. The company expanded access with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/claude-code-gets-a-web-version-but-its-the-new-sandboxing-that-really-matters/&quot;&gt;web interface&lt;/a&gt; in October 2025, followed by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropics-claude-code-can-now-read-your-slack-messages-and-write-code-for&quot;&gt;Slack integration&lt;/a&gt; in December. Cowork is the next logical step: bringing the same agentic architecture to users who may never touch a terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who can access Cowork now, and what&amp;#x27;s coming next for Windows and other platforms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Cowork remains exclusive to &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11014257-about-claude-s-max-plan-usage&quot;&gt;Claude Max subscribers&lt;/a&gt; using the macOS desktop application. Users on other subscription tiers — Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise — can join a waitlist for future access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic has signaled clear intentions to expand the feature&amp;#x27;s reach. The blog post explicitly mentions plans to add cross-device sync and bring Cowork to Windows as the company learns from the research preview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cherny set expectations appropriately, describing the product as &amp;quot;early and raw, similar to what Claude Code felt like when it first launched.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To access &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview&quot;&gt;Cowork&lt;/a&gt;, Max subscribers can download or update the Claude macOS app and click on &amp;quot;Cowork&amp;quot; in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The real question facing enterprise AI adoption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For technical decision-makers, the implications of Cowork extend beyond any single product launch. The bottleneck for AI adoption is shifting — no longer is model intelligence the limiting factor, but rather workflow integration and user trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic&amp;#x27;s goal, as the company puts it, is to make working with Claude feel less like operating a tool and more like delegating to a colleague. Whether mainstream users are ready to hand over folder access to an AI that might misinterpret their instructions remains an open question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the speed of Cowork&amp;#x27;s development — a major feature built in ten days, possibly by the company&amp;#x27;s own AI — previews a future where the capabilities of these systems compound faster than organizations can evaluate them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chatbot has learned to use a file manager. What it learns to use next is anyone&amp;#x27;s guess.&lt;/p&gt;</p> </div> </section> <aside class="sidebar"> <div class="sidebar-card"> <h3>Resource Details</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Category:</strong> Research</li> <li><strong>Layer:</strong> brain</li> </ul> <a href="https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropic-launches-cowork-a-claude-desktop-agent-that-works-in-your-files-no" target="_blank" class="visit-btn">Visit Original Source</a> </div> </aside> </div> </main>  </body></html>
