While one agent runs a test suite, another refactors a legacy module, and a third drafts documentation. He also runs &amp;quot;5-10 Claudes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.ai/&quot;&gt;claude.ai&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; in his browser, using a &amp;quot;teleport&amp;quot; command to hand off sessions between the web and his local machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This validates the &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/03/anthropic-daniela-amodei-do-more-with-less-bet.html&quot;&gt;do more with less&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; strategy articulated by Anthropic President Daniela Amodei earlier this week. While competitors like OpenAI pursue trillion-dollar infrastructure build-outs, Anthropic is proving that superior orchestration of existing models can yield exponential productivity gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The counterintuitive case for choosing the slowest, smartest model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a surprising move for an industry obsessed with latency, Cherny revealed that he exclusively uses Anthropic&amp;#x27;s heaviest, slowest model: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5&quot;&gt;Opus 4.5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything,&amp;quot; Cherny &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179838864666847&quot;&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s the best coding model I&amp;#x27;ve ever used, and even though it&amp;#x27;s bigger &amp;amp; slower than Sonnet, since you have to steer it less and it&amp;#x27;s better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For enterprise technology leaders, this is a critical insight. The bottleneck in modern AI development isn&amp;#x27;t the generation speed of the token; it is the human time spent correcting the AI&amp;#x27;s mistakes. Cherny&amp;#x27;s workflow suggests that paying the &amp;quot;compute tax&amp;quot; for a smarter model upfront eliminates the &amp;quot;correction tax&amp;quot; later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;One shared file turns every AI mistake into a permanent lesson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cherny also detailed how his team solves the problem of AI amnesia. Standard large language models do not &amp;quot;remember&amp;quot; a company&amp;#x27;s specific coding style or architectural decisions from one session to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, Cherny&amp;#x27;s team maintains a single file named &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179842928947333&quot;&gt;CLAUDE.md&lt;/a&gt; in their git repository. &amp;quot;Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time,&amp;quot; he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practice transforms the codebase into a self-correcting organism. When a human developer reviews a pull request and spots an error, they don&amp;#x27;t just fix the code; they tag the AI to update its own instructions. &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/aakashgupta/status/2007347705945944153&quot;&gt;Every mistake becomes a rule&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; noted &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/aakashgupta&quot;&gt;Aakash Gupta&lt;/a&gt;, a product leader analyzing the thread. The longer the team works together, the smarter the agent becomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slash commands and subagents automate the most tedious parts of development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;vanilla&amp;quot; workflow one observer praised is powered by rigorous automation of repetitive tasks. Cherny uses slash commands — custom shortcuts checked into the project&amp;#x27;s repository — to handle complex operations with a single keystroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He highlighted a command called &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;/commit-push-pr&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, which he invokes dozens of times daily. Instead of manually typing git commands, writing a commit message, and opening a pull request, the agent handles the bureaucracy of version control autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cherny also deploys subagents — specialized AI personas — to handle specific phases of the development lifecycle. He uses a code-simplifier to clean up architecture after the main work is done and a verify-app agent to run end-to-end tests before anything ships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why verification loops are the real unlock for AI-generated code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is a single reason Claude Code has reportedly hit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone&quot;&gt;$1 billion in annual recurring revenue&lt;/a&gt; so quickly, it is likely the verification loop.
